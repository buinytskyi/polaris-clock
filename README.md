## Polaris Clock(Nocturnal)
A nocturnal is an instrument used to determine the local time based on the position of a star in the night sky relative to the pole star. As a result of the Earth's rotation, any fixed star makes a full revolution around the pole star in 23 hours and 56 minutes and therefore can be used as an hour hand. 
To check the time at night using the Polaris Clock, first set your location on a globe map.
Once that's done, look up at the night sky and find the Big Dipper and the North Star.
The Big Dipper should match the position shown on the screen.

If you find North Star(Polaris) you can determine cardinal direction, because it's pointer on the true North.
- Locate the Big Dipper – Look for its distinct shape in the northern sky. It's a group of seven bright stars forming a ladle or dipper.
- Use the Pointer Stars – The two stars at the end of the Big Dipper’s bowl, Dubhe and Merak, act as guides. Draw an imaginary line from Merak through Dubhe and extend it about five times the distance between them.
- Spot Polaris – The line leads you directly to Polaris, which isn’t the brightest star but is reliably positioned almost due north.
